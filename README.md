This project explores key factors influencing the success of movies, using correlation analysis to understand relationships between various movie attributes like budget, revenue, ratings, and more.

🔍 Key Insights from Correlation Analysis

1. 💰 Budget vs. Revenue:

A strong positive correlation suggests that higher-budget movies often generate higher revenue. This indicates that greater investment in production, marketing, and star power likely translates to box office success.
However, some outliers may suggest that low-budget movies with compelling stories can also achieve high revenue.

2. 🌟 Rating vs. Revenue:

A moderate positive correlation shows that movies with higher ratings tend to perform better financially, highlighting the importance of quality content and audience satisfaction.
The presence of exceptions suggests that not all critically acclaimed movies are box office hits and vice versa.

3. ⏳ Runtime vs. Revenue/Rating:

Runtime has a mixed impact on revenue and ratings. A slight positive correlation suggests that longer movies may provide more in-depth storytelling, attracting higher ratings and sometimes more revenue.
On the other hand, movies with shorter runtimes can also succeed, especially in fast-paced genres like action or comedy.

4. 📅 Release Year vs. Revenue:

A positive correlation with more recent movies earning higher revenue reflects the growing global market and inflation-adjusted earnings.
This trend also suggests the impact of modern marketing strategies and expanded distribution channels.

5. 🔥 Popularity vs. Revenue/Rating:

A strong correlation between popularity and revenue indicates that movies generating buzz often perform well at the box office.
Popular movies often receive mixed ratings, suggesting that hype doesn’t always align with critical reception.

6. 🎭 Genre Influence:

Some genres show stronger correlations with revenue and ratings, indicating audience preferences for particular types of stories.
The diversity of success across genres suggests that both niche and mainstream genres can thrive under the right conditions.
